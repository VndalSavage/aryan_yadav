            It is no secret that social media has had an intense effect on the ways that people view the world around them. In terms of serious matters, including crime coverage and the opinions surrounding it, there is absolutely no exception. This podcast is a discussion between students who are very aware of the media and how it works and how the use of social media has had an effect on well-known crimes of the past. It showcases just how much this trend can continue to affect the motions and outcomes of crimes in the future.
